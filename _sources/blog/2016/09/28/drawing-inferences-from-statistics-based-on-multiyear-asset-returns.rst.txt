Drawing Inferences from Statistics based on Multiyear Asset Returns
###################################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

Random walk finance model of stock prices using multiyear returns has recently
gained traction due to promising attempts of uncovering low-frequency
correlations in the data (e.g. slowly mean-reverting component of stock prices).
Statistical findings such as long-run negative correlation in stock returns have
generally been assessed using asymptotic theory (e.g. checking whether the
estimates lie within two standard errors of the null).  This theory seems to
provide a poor approximation to the sampling distribution according to the
latest Monte Carlo experiments, which brings up the question whether the
long-term trends and patterns are valid.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The major practical value of asymptotic theory is to provide a robust
approximation to the small-sample distribution of the statistics; determining
which theory is most appropriate reduces to an empirical question.  Monte Carlo
simulations of the multiyear statistics demonstrate that the proposed theory
provides a much better approximation to the finite-sample distributions.

The proposed alternative asymptotic distribution theory treats the overlap in
the data (denoted as :math:`J`) as tending to a fixed nonzero fraction
(:math:`\delta`) of the sample size :math:`T`, whereas the conventional theory
treats :math:`J` as fixed so that :math:`\frac{J}{T} \rightarrow 0`.  The fixed
:math:`J` theory implies statistics such as variance ratios and autocorrelations
of multiyear returns are consistent and have asymptotic normal distributions;
this may be a poor approximation since the number of non-overlapping
observations can still be small despite a large sample size.  In contrast, the
:math:`\frac{J}{T} \rightarrow \delta` theory imply the statistics are not
consistent and have limiting distributions that are typically functionals of
Brownian motion.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The numerical evaluation of nonstandard asymptotic distributions by a sequence
of Monte Carlo simulations is increasingly common.  The empirical results show
that the Monte Carlo percentiles converge rapidly for the proposed theory, which
verifies that the reduced number of rejections in statistical tests is accurate.
In contrast, the fixed :math:`J` theory failed to capture the skewness of the
Monte Carlo distributions.  This authors assert that their usage of asymptotic
:math:`p`-values for statistics with nonnormal limits are more appropriate than
the typical two-standard errors.  However, they admitted the conclusions drawn
from using these values are weaker than conventional standard errors.  The
statistics considered in this paper cannot provide decisive evidence for
economic theories in which mean reversion at long horizons plays a central role.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- Is this indicator still reliable (e.g. prediction of 2008 crash)?

Question(s)
===========

- What background knowledge is needed to understand the derivations?

Analysis
========

Finance models need to take into account overlapping data and finite-sample
distributions.  While the idea of using Monte Carlo percentiles to verify the
simulations' accuracy is very intriguing idea, the usage of :math:`p`-values is
not so convincing.  It seems the authors favored
:doc:`statistical over economic significance </blog/2016/09/18/the-standard-error-of-regressions>`.

Notes
=====

Variance-Ratio Statistics
-------------------------

- If returns are serially uncorrelated, the variance of the
  :math:`J`-period return will increasely linearly with :math:`J`.
- If there is mean reversion, where the returns are negatively correlated, the
  variance of the :math:`J`-period return will increase less than linearly.

Multiyear Autocorrelation Statistics
------------------------------------

- The :math:`F`-test provides a simple way to check whether the restrictions
  on multiperiod correlations apply simultaneously.
- If there is mean reversion in stock prices over a long horizon, the
  following statistics are heuristics to detect that: sum of multiyear
  correlations, maximum correlation, minimum correlation, or maximum absolute
  correlation.
- The use of overlapping data will induce a moving average process in the
  error term of a regression model.
