The Standard Error of Regressions
#################################

Motivation(s)
=============

Less thoughful researchers have accepted statistical significance as a valid and
reliable indicator to make decisions.  This mindset is still prevalent despite
the counter-arguments.  Actual investigations should depend on substantive not
merely statistical significance because

- a difference can be permanent without being significant,
- and a difference can be significant yet be insignificant statistically.

With such recurrent thinking and a lack of empirical studies measuring the use
of statistical significance in economics, the author hypothesized researchers
were equating statistical significance with economic significance.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

Since statistical significance have not led to any scientific success, the
proposed methodology excludes statistical significance and consists only of
simulations, new data sets, and quantitative thinking.

Evaluation(s)
=============

A survey of the most widespread statistics and economics books reveal only
two authors, Morris DeGroot and Arthur Goldberger, ever qualified the difference
between economic significance and statistical significance; albeit the
discussion was limited to at most a page.

Analyzing a corpus of publications from the American Economic Review revealed
that three-quarters of researchers merge statistical significance with economic
significance.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- How can counterfactual analysis be applied as an alternative to statistical
  significance?
- Which area of study also exhibit this problem?

Question(s)
-----------

- Would Bayesian statistics mitigate the mentioned issues?
- When can one accept the null hypothesis?

Analysis
========

This is a must-read for all beginning students in statistics.  Statistical
significance and confidence intervals have been the usual buzzwords ever since
machine learning took off.  These survey questions could serve as a reference to
determine whether a paper provides deeper insights than some tests.  Putting
type I and type II errors aside, it is surprising that applied statisticians
tend to forget that statistical significance cannot answer any questions and the
relative importance of all possible errors will depend on the special purposes
of the investigation.  One should always keep in mind:

- How large is large?
- Neyman-Pearson Lemma specifies the null hypothesis as something the researcher
  believes to be true.

  - Only the rejection of the null hypothesis can be taken as a definitive
    conclusion.
  - Failing to reject does not imply that the null is therefore true.
  - Rejecting the null does not imply that the alternative hypothesis is true.
