The Myth of Long-Horizon Predictability
#######################################

Motivation(s)
=============

One of the dominant stylized facts in empirical finance is multivariate stock
return predictability, regressing on dividend yields, over multiple horizons.
The key determinants of long-horizon predictability are the extent of
predictability at short horizons and the persistence of the regressor; higher
persistence results in a higher fraction of explainable long-horizon returns.
This interpretation has been criticized for

- Data Snooping

  - Levels of predictability found at short horizons are not surprising, given
    the number of variables from which researchers can choose.

- Estimator biases on small sample.

  - The predictive variable's persistence and the negative correlation between
    contemporaneous shocks to returns and the predictive variable needs to be
    taken into account.

- Asymptotic theory where the horizon increases with the sample size.

  - Long-horizon regressions may no longer be consistent and have limiting
    distributions that are functionals of Brownian motions.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors assert that researchers should be equally impressed by the short-
and long-horizon evidence since the regressions are almost perfectly correlated.
Existing measures (e.g. :math:`R^2`) emphasize longer horizon due to the
sampling error that shows up in regressions with small samples.

To capture the correlations across multiple-horizon estimators, the authors
propose analytic expressions that relate the correlations across these
estimators to both the degree of overlap across the horizons and the
predictive variable's level of persistence.

While a high level of persistence means that it can be dangerous to interpret
regressions over multiple horizons, the proposed joint Wald tests show that this
persistence may lead to powerful tests for economies in which predictability
exists.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The authors simulate 75 years of annual data under the null hypothesis of no
predictability with horizons spanning one to five years.  The results exhibited
the expected increase in the coefficient estimates as a function of the horizon.
Any sampling error in the data appears in the same manner in every
multiple-horizon regression when the predictive variable is highly persistent.
The high degree of correlation across the multi-period estimators implies the
regressions are essentially redundant, and the estimators are asymptotically
distributed as multivariate normal with a mean of zero.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- How to utilize the daily activities of a company to predict the direction
  of its earnings?

Question(s)
===========

- Why choose the Wald test over likelihood-ratio?

Analysis
========

The paper would have been better if the author had explicitly discussed the
result's trend and significance instead of having the reader interpret the
figures.  Moreover, it could have been summarized succinctly; nevertheless, the
derived equations may be a useful future reference.  While the overall work is
merely presenting a different analysis, it is worthwhile to note:

- When dealing with multiple estimators, look at the individual results as well
  as the aggregate.
- Statistical tests should be examined qualitatively and go beyond
  trendspotting.
