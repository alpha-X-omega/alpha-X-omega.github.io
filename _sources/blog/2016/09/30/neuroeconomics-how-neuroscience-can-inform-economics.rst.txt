Neuroeconomics: How Neuroscience Can Inform Economics
#####################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

The foundations of economic theory were constructed assuming that the details of
the brain's black box would not be known.  In order to sidestep this limitation,
economists combined subjective expected utility with the rational choice theory
and the revealed preference theory from psychology; the latter theory simply
equated unobserved preferences with observed choices.  This resulted in the
establishment of behavioral economics whose theories are reasonable as long as
the brain remained a black box, but the brain is slowly being demystified as
recent advances in neuroscience start to enable direct measurement of thoughts
and feelings.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors assert neuroscience can make incremental and radical contributions
to economics.  The former enhances existing models of decision making (e.g.
dynamic cross-partial effects in utility for commodity bundles, environmental
cues trigger unpleasant cravings and increase demand) while the latter forms a
different foundation for economic theory.  This foundation has been branded as
neuroeconomics and focuses on the interaction between controlled and automatic
processes, and between cognitive and affective systems unlike the existing
theory that represents decisions in a deliberative equilibrium.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The authors' goal is to showcase some key findings and neuroscience and
stimulate the reader's curiosity about the implications for economics.  The
latest advancements (e.g. EEG, PET, fMRI, TMS, EBS, DTI, electrophysiology,
psychophysical) indicate neural functioning can be described in terms of
cognitive, affective, controlled, and automatic processes.  The survey of
experimental findings provide possible alternative explanations that are more
sound than economic models with arbitrary assumptions.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- How to apply Bayesian models and likelihoods to simulate specialized functions
  such as the mentalizing module?
- Monitor the brain activity of day traders at different experience levels.

Question(s)
===========

- How consistent are the proposed methods of evaluation?

Analysis
========

Neuroscience provides a way to replace the arbitrary assumptions in economic
models with consistent parameters reflective of neurological functions.  Since
the suggestive evidence are still being studied further, the authors should have
tried to incorporate these findings into economic models and evaluate the
impact.

One of the interesting points was that companies have already made use of the
fact consumers have a preference for prepayment (even though it is financially
irrational), and they will go to great lengths to avoid having consumers think
about marginal cost.

Some of the experiments, such as measuring cognitive load, are quite
questionable.  How can memorizing digits of differing lengths and choosing to
eat a cake or fruit salad have any implications on self-control?  Furthermore,
the authors raised the question of whether Bayesian modeling is appropriate to
describe specialized neurological functions.  Wouldn't a completely precise
process be even more unlikely?

Notes
=====

Economic Constructs
-------------------

- Economists assume the following characteristics are stable within an
  individual and consistent across activities: time preference, risk preference,
  and altruism.
- Empirical evidence shows these dimensions are very weakly correlated or
  uncorrelated across situations since preferences are state-contingent and that
  people may not recognize state-contingency.

Domain-Specific Expertise
-------------------------

- Economics implicitly assumes people have general cognitive capabilities that
  can be applied to any type of problem and will perform equivalently on
  problems that have similar structures.
- The existence of systems that evolved to perform specific functions
  (e.g. the mentalizing module) suggests that performance will depend critically
  on whether a problem that one confronts can be processed by a specialized
  system that is well adapted to that form of processing.

Utility for Money
-----------------

- The canonical economic model assumes that the utility for money is indirect
  i.e. that money is a mere counter, only valued for the goods and services it
  can procure.
- Neural evidence suggests that the same dopaminergic reward circuitry of the
  brain in the midbrain (mesolimbic system) is activated for a wide variety of
  different reinforcers e.g. attractive faces, funny cartoons, cultural
  objects, drugs, money.

  - Asset pricing models that incorporated stock returns exhibited increased
    descriptive power in explaining returns patterns.

Wanting and Liking
------------------

- Economists view behavior as a search for pleasure and people will be better
  off when they get what they want.
- Neuroscience argues that decision making involves the interaction between
  the liking system (e.g. pleasure pain) and the wanting system (e.g.
  motivation).

  - When these systems diverge, the welfare economists' assumptions are invalid.

Cognitive Inaccessibility
-------------------------

- People lack introspective access to the source of their own judgements of
  behavior leads to discriminatory biases, self-deception, self-manipulation,
  and failure to understand the reasons behind their choices.

Intertemporal Choice and Self-Control
-------------------------------------

- Economists view intertemporal choice as a trade-off of utility at different
  points in time.

  - Individual differences in the way that people make this tradeoff are
    captured by the arbitrary notion of a discount rate, a rate at which people
    discount future utilities as a function of when they occur.

- Empirical neuroscience research suggested intertemporal choice can be viewed
  as a splice of two processes: an impulsive, affective, cognitive process and
  a more far-sighted deliberate process guided by the prefrontal cortex.

  - Greater relative activity in affective systems was associated with choosing
    earlier rewards more often.

- Individual automatic processes involving pattern matching, recognition, and
  categorization also influences choice e.g. a preference for sequences of
  outcomes that improve over time, a preference for flat sequences, a preference
  for immediate rewards.

Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty
------------------------------------------

- People's deliberative selves are not at peace with their visceral reactions to
  risks e.g. fear unleashes preprogrammed sequences of behavior that aren't
  always beneficial.
- Insufficient fear can produce nonmaximizing behavior when risker options have
  negative value.
- When guessing probabilities, the left hemisphere of the brain is more active;
  but when answering logic questions, the right hemisphere is more active.

Game Theory
-----------

- The classic theory assumes the players:

  #. have accurate beliefs about what others will do i.e. players are in
     equilibrium;
  #. have no emotions or concern about how much others earn;
  #. plan ahead;
  #. and learn from experience.

- fMRI studies seem to suggest that game theory may need some modifications.

  - The insula is a neural locus activated by the distaste for inequality or
    unfair treatment posited by models of social utility.
  - The oxytocin hormone level, which rises during social bonding, affects how
    one perceives the trustyworthyness of others.
  - Circadian rhythms affect people's ability to suppress or avoid acting on
    unwanted feelings.
  - A good reputation (perception) may be neurally encoded in a way similar to
    rewarding stimuli.

- Backward induction means figuring out what to do today by and reasoning how
  others will behave at all possible future points and working backward.

  - Economists are inclided to characterize this as cognitively costly.
  - Studies have shown that this can be learned and automated.

- Camerer-Ho reinforcement two process theory and Glimcher's parietal neuron
  measurements suggest that neurons are encoding expected reward values.

Labor-Market Discrimination
---------------------------

- Economists assume labor-market discrimination against minorities is either a
  distaste for working with minorities, or a belief that minority workers are
  less productive.
- Through the use of implicit association tests (IATs), neuroscience suggests
  discrimination involves rapid, automatic, associations between social
  categories, stereotypes, and affect.
