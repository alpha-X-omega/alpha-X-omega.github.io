#################################################################################################
The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness: A Procedure and Some Preliminary Findings
#################################################################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

Existing studies on the social psychology of close relationships have been
limited to comparing those in and not in close relationships, or those in
relationships that are close to various degrees.  All of these approaches lack
the ability to individually manipulate the existence of a close relationship,
the characteristics of its members, and the circumstances under which the
relationship developed.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The proposed methodology allows each of those issues to be treated as an
independent variable.  It centers around sustained, escalating, reciprocal,
personalistic self-disclosure between complete strangers.  There is no need
to create an artificial expectation that the subject's partner would like him or
her, and the participants can have differing attitudes on issues of personal
importance.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The questionnaire's goal is to develop a temporary feeling of closeness, not
intimacy.  Nevertheless, the following studies received high post-experiment
ratings of closeness and anecdotal reports of the impact of the experience over
the next few months showed one pair even got married:

- Study 1: Effectiveness of self-disclosure versus small-talk on closeness.

  - Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) Scale

    - Exhibits high levels of test-retest and alternate-form reliability and
      convergent and discriminant validity.
    - Capable of predicting relationship maintenance over three months.

  - Subjective Closeness Index

    - Complements IOS since it measures directly the feeling of closeness.

- Study 2: Does agreement or expectation of liking affect closeness?

  - Interpersonal Judgement Scale

    - "How much would you like to work with your partner on a project?"
    - "How much do you like your partner?"

- Study 3: Effectiveness of making closeness an explicit task between subjects.

  - Myers-Briggs Type Indicator determined the subjects' match based on their
    introversion/extraversion type.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- What is a practical procedure for invoking intimacy?
- How to smoothly incorporate this on a date?
- How to go about developing more questions along these lines?

Question(s)
===========

- Why focus on statistical significance?
- Does a mixture of both questionnaires improve closeness?
- How were these questions developed?

Analysis
========

Both questionnaires seem appropriate for dates since both involves sharing of
non-trivial knowledge between participants.  It is surprising that the subjects
rated their relationship to their partners of less than an hour to be about as
close as the average relationship in their lives and in other people's lives.
The paper's analysis should have presented some kind of graphics instead of
a wall of text.  Moreover, the author should have justified why and how these
set of questions came about.

Notes
=====

Erikson's Ego Identity Model
----------------------------

- Low ego-identity individuals fear cross-sex intimacy in which they might lose
  their identity and thus get close only if they feel they can protect
  themselves from too much intimacy.
- Same-sex friendships for those who have not developed an ego identity serve as
  identity supports, but for those who have developed an identity, they serve as
  sources of undesired conformity that threatens one's individuated identity.
