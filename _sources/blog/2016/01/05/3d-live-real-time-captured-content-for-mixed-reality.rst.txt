3D Live: Real Time Captured Content for Mixed Reality
#####################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

All researchers perceive perfect telepresence as the end goal of AR.  The latest
AR technology is capable of superimposing 2D textual information onto real world
objects, inserting 3D graphical objects, and displaying 2D single-view video
streams of collaborators.  The only way to achieve a 360-view of the
collaborator at the moment is to animate a pre-scanned model.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors propose an image-based novel view generation using
shape-from-silhouette.  This technique assumes the :math:`n` cameras' intrinsic
and extrinsic parameters are available, which restricts the visual hull
construction to the visible parts.  See section 3 for a summary of the algorithm
in pseudocode.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The experimental system was capable of augmenting QVGA quality 360-views.  The
most apparent limitation is that the subject needs to be present in each of the
camera.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- Which medium enhances student learning: dynamic ebooks, virtual reality
  reconstruction, or augmented holographic content?

Question(s)
===========

- The points on the visual hull does not correspond to real surface points, but
  can it restrict the region to perform structure from motion?

Analysis
========

With a known environment and cameras, the only limitation in a 360-view system
is the computational power.

The end goal is very useful, but this approach requires too much
instrumentation.  However, perhaps another non-line-of-sight technology could
reuse this technology to achieve high-resolution 360-view.  Each design decision
was well-thought-out and adds on minimal complexity.
