High-Accuracy Stereo Depth Maps Using Structured Light
######################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

The recent resurgence of interest in stereo correspondence has been spurred by
breakthroughs in matching strategies, optimization algorithms, and a lack of
complex ground truth data sets.  Previous works have focused entirely on
hand-labeled or trivial synthetic content.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors propose structured light patterns to uniquely label each pixel,
which is used to establish inter-image correspondence.  This technique needs a
pair of cameras and one or more light projectors.  See the end of section 2 for
the processing pipeline.

Evaluation(s)
=============

Several high quality depth maps were generated using a single camera, a linear
stage to translate the camera, and a single video projector.  One advantage of
this approach is that the rectified view disparities mitigate the need to
calibrate video projectors.  One disadvantage is the lack of scene
interreflections.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- Would a camera simulation with synthetic scenery be an accurate measure of
  this technique and its improved variations?
- How much would the accuracy improve if the view disparity estimates were done
  via probabilistic programming?

Question(s)
===========

- Would a better projector simplify gray-code decoding?

Analysis
========

Structured light gray code patterns can vastly improve the precision of depth
maps generated by stereo cameras.

The view disparity estimates and how the disparity estimates were combined seems
kind of hackish.  It is interesting to note that gray codes yield better results
because the proposed technique can avoid estimating the albedo.  On the other
hand, sine waves are susceptible to scene interreflections and nonlinearities of
the camera and projector.

Notes
=====

- Structured Light

  - Gray Codes

    - Since only one bit changes at a time, it is suited for binary position
      encoding.
    - Requires :math:`\log_2 n` patterns to distinguish :math:`n` locations.
    - Decoding

      - Need code pattern and its inverse.

        - Fogging inside projector adds a low-frequency average of intensities
          to the projected pattern.
        - Take the brighter of the pattern to be the label.

      - Need different exposures to distinguish light patterns.

        - Shadowed areas, low albedo surfaces, high reflectance, or oblique
          angles typically result in unknown labels.

      - Since each illumination pixel is 2-4 camera pixels wide, gray codes are
        interpolated along prominent directions using a sliding 1D window.

  - Sine Waves

    - Takes advantage of gray-level resolution to reduce the number of required
      images or improve the precision for the same number of images.
    - Projects patterns at two frequencies and 12 phases.
    - Decoding

      - Assuming a linear image formation process, reformulate the problem to be
        linear in the number of unknowns.
      - Use linear least squares to solve for the information matrix.

- Disparity Computation

  - View disparities

    - Independently compute LR and RL disparities and cross-check.

  - Illumination Disparities

    - Pixels that have high residual errors are treated as outliers.
    - The projective depth and pixel code values can be used to solve for the
      illumination source's projection matrix via least squares in homogeneous
      coordinates.
