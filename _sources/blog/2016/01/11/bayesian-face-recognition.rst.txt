Bayesian Face Recognition
#########################

Motivation(s)
=============

Existing face recognition systems rely on similarity metrics based on Euclidean
distance or normalized correlation, which corresponds to template-matching i.e.
nearest-neighbor.  The drawback of these metrics is that they do not exploit
knowledge of which types of variation are critical in expressing similarity.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors propose a probabilistic similarity measure based on the image
differences to characterize facial image variations into intrapersonal and
extrapersonal variations.  This Bayesian formulation casts the M-ary
classification problem into a binary classification problem i.e.
:math:`Pr(\Omega_I \mid \Updelta) > Pr(\Omega_E \mid \Updelta)`.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The proposed metric was compared with the eigenface matching algorithm using the
ARPA FERET dataset.  The cumulative match score showed that the probabilistic
metric bested the baseline by 10-20%.  An additional benefit is that the
database only needs to store a single image of an individual through the use of
the whitening transformation (7).

Future Direction(s)
===================

- How does this compare to multi-linear models?

Question(s)
===========

- Do the image differences of different individuals live in close proximity in
  the proposed subspace?

Analysis
========

Modeling some observations with a Gaussian establishes a good baseline.  This
approach can be viewed as an application of factor analyzers.  The Bayesian
formulation is brilliant, but I'm not too convinced of the image difference
metric.  As the authors admitted, multiple models should be used for dealing
with large pose variations to avoid diluting the density models.
