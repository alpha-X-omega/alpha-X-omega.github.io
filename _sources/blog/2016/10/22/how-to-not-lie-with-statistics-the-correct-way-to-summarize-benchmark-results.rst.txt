How Not to Lie with Statistics: The Correct Way to Summarize Benchmark Results
##############################################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

In comparing computers according to some metric (e.g. object size, run time,
throughput), it is common to run benchmarks, normalize the results to a
"known machine", and then average these normalized quantities.  Unfortunately,
the arithmetic mean of performance ratios has led to wrong conclusions in some
cases.  There are alternative statistics, such as the geometric mean, that
yield correct results at the cost of intuition.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors examine these misuse of statistics and propose guidelines to avoid
the common pitfalls of summarizing results.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The analysis focused on benchmarks published in seminal papers.

Through a series of examples, it is evident that the arithmetic mean produces
inconsistent answers due to normalization.  However, the arithmetic mean or
sum of raw, unnormalized numbers (arbitrarily weighted) can work if the result
has inherent meaning.

The authors proved that the weighted geometric mean's multiplicative property
makes it invariant to normalization, thus achieving consistent results.  The
multiplicative property can be thought of as the mean of the products equals the
product of the means.  This property reduces relative performance comparisons
to daily common sense:

- Suppose machine X is A times as fast as machine Y.
- Suppose machine Y is B times as fast as machine Z.
- Machine X should be AB times as fast as machine Z.

The authors admitted that any measure of the mean is misleading when there is
large variance and benchmark results should be presented via a box plot.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- How practical is applying learning to rank to design a metric for system
  performance i.e. make the process more data driven?

Question(s)
===========

- Why make the proof of the geometric mean's multiplicative property so overly
  complicated when it's just two lines?

Analysis
========

The rules in the notes should be followed except for rule 2 since the geometric
mean produces :doc:`incorrect results </blog/2016/10/23/characterizing-computer-performance-with-a-single-number>`.
Even though the intuition of why the geometric mean is desirable is clear, its
interpretation is still baffling.  In addition, the emphasis on the geometric
mean's multiplicative property seems unnecessary considering the single-numbers
are used to impose a total ordering.

Notes
=====

Rule 1: Do Not Use the Arithmetic Mean to Average Normalized Numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- The arithmetic mean of normalized numbers are meaningless.

  - Consequently, the sum of normalized numbers is also meaningless.

Rule 2: Use the Geometric Mean to Average Normalized Numbers
------------------------------------------------------------

- The geometric mean can be used regardless of how the numbers are normalized.
- The geometric mean can be used even if the numbers are not normalized; the
  resulting means can then be normalized.

Rule 3: Use the Arithmetic Mean (or Sum) of Raw, Unnormalized Results Only When This "Total" is Meaningful
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ratios of unnormalized sums can be taken to determine relative performance.
- Each summand can be weighted to simulate some desired property.
