Characterizing Computer Performance with a Single Number
########################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

Even though computer performance is fundamentally multidimensional, researchers
that analyze the performance of different systems tend to focus on a single
number.  Thus, it is important that the best single-number measure be used;
otherwise, the results could be off by several orders of magnitude.  This issue
have spurred researchers to analyze single-number measures such as the
arithmetic mean and geometric mean.  The outcome of the study favored the
geometric mean due to its
:doc:`consistency </blog/2016/10/22/how-to-not-lie-with-statistics-the-correct-way-to-summarize-benchmark-results>`.
Unfortunately, the geometric mean is consistently wrong.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The author asserts that the time required to perform a specified amount of
computation is the ultimate measure of computer performance due to its intuitive
appeal and unambiguous context.  If the desired measure is a rate that is some
entity per unit time, then it should be highly correlated with the time measure.
These are the properties a good measure must exhibit.

Evaluation(s)
=============

Instead of tackling the issue of designing accurate benchmark, the author
studies how the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic mean maintains the accuracy
of the original benchmarks.

Let :math:`T_i` and :math:`F_i` denote respectively the time benchmark :math:`i`
took to accomplish some work.  Define :math:`M_i = \frac{F_i}{T_i}` as the rate
of doing work.  Defining the means in these terms yields

.. math::

   A_\text{mean} &= \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i M_i =
       \sum_{i = 1}^n w_i \frac{F_i}{T_i}\\
   \\
   G_\text{mean} &= \prod_{i = 1}^n M_i^{w_i} =
       \prod_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{F_i}{T_i} \right)^{w_i}\\
   \\
   H_\text{mean} &= \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{w_i}{M_i} \right)^{-1} =
       \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{w_i}{F_i} T_i \right)^{-1}.

Observe that the harmonic mean is the only measure in accordance with
Amdahlâ€™s law.  Applying these measures to published benchmark results confirms
that only the arithmetic and harmonic mean satisfy the proposed good properties.
Moreover, the geometric mean yields consistent but contradictory results that
are blatantly wrong.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- It seems that previous papers came to the wrong conclusion because their
  examples were not exhaustive enough.  How many existing performance measures
  would pass if they were to be applied to seminal benchmark results?

Question(s)
===========

- When would the geometric mean be applicable to performance?

Analysis
========

This paper rejects :doc:`rule 2 </blog/2016/10/22/how-to-not-lie-with-statistics-the-correct-way-to-summarize-benchmark-results>`,
proposes the harmonic mean as a replacement for the geometric mean, and
recommends normalization only be applied after computing an aggregate
performance measure.  Note that the harmonic mean does not exhibit the desired
multiplicative property.  Overall, the formulations of the arithmetic,
geometric, and harmonic mean crystallized when one measure is preferred over the
others.

Notes
=====

Properties of Good Performance Measures
---------------------------------------

#. A single-number performance measure for a set of benchmarks expressed in
   units of time should be directly proportional to the total (weighted) time
   consumed by the benchmarks.
#. A single-number performance measure for benchmarks expressed as a rate should
   be inversely proportional to the total (weighted) time consumed by the
   benchmarks.
