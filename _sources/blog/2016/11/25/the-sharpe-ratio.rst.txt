The Sharpe Ratio
################

Motivation(s)
=============

The reward-to-variability ratio is a measure for the performance of mutual
funds.  Since its introduction, it has gained considerable popularity under a
different name: the Sharpe Ratio.  To further exacerbate the confusion around
the current jargon, several studies have generalized the measure under various
names such as return information ratio.  The return information ratio
encompasses the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation of the distribution
of the return on a single investment.  While this statistic may be useful, it
could lead to wrong decisions because it does not account for the riskless
rate of interest.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The author proposes unifying these different terms under the Sharpe Ratio and
examines a broad range of applications.

This study builds on the Markowitz mean-variance paradigm, which assumes that
the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of one-period return are
sufficient statistics for evaluating the prospects of an investment portfolio.
The focus is on the use of the ratio for making decisions in situations where
the first two moments can be usefully summarized with the ratio.  Correlations
between historic Sharpe Ratios and unbiased forecasts of the ratio are left for
other expositions.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The differential return represents the result of a zero-investment strategy i.e.
any strategy that involves a zero outlay of money in the present and returns
either a positive, negative or zero amount in the future.  To compute the return
for a zero-investment strategy, the payoff is divided by a notional value.  One
of the benefits of the Sharpe Ratio is its scale independence to the notional
value.

The author derives that the expected return on assets is directly related to the
product of the risk position times the Sharpe Ratio of the strategy.  This
statistic is sufficient for decisions on the optimal risk/return combination
when

- an investor plans to allocate money between a riskless asset and a single
  risky fund, or
- a single fund is to be selected to complement a pre-existing group of risky
  investments.

The optimal solution for each scenario involves maximizing the Sharpe Ratio of
the zero-investment strategy.  However, the latter requires that all the
funds in the set from have similar correlations with the other holdings.

When an investor has a pre-existing set of investments and is considering taking
positions in one or more independent and uncorrelated zero-investment
strategies, the Sharpe Ratios of the strategies is proportional to their risk
levels.

Future Direction(s)

  and :doc:`momentum </blog/2016/09/24/profitability-of-momentum-strategies-an-evaluation-of-alternative-explanations>`
  strategies have yielded a modest amount of annual gains.  Would applying the
  Sharpe Ratio in a similar automated fashion yield equivalent or better
  results?
- To account for correlation, would simply clustering the funds according to
  their :doc:`style factors </blog/2016/10/13/empirical-characteristics-of-dynamic-trading-strategies-the-case-of-hedge-funds>`
  be appropriate?

Question(s)
===========

- The author claims that annualizing data that apply to periods other than one
  year before computing a Sharpe Ratio can provide at least reasonably
  meaningful comparisons among strategies, even if predictions are initially
  stated in terms of different measurement periods.  Another claim is that it
  is usually desirable to measure risks and returns using fairly short (e.g.
  monthly) periods.  If the Sharpe Ratio is a measure, would plotting this
  measure over time instead of aggregating the data be useful?

Analysis
========

The Sharpe Ratio is designed to measure the expected return per unit of risk for
a zero investment strategy.  The Sharpe Ratio does not cover cases in which only
one investment return is involved, and it does not account for correlations.

While the derivations of the measure are intuitive and useful, the paper would
be more interesting if the author reported monthly and annual Sharpe Ratio
estimates of existing funds (e.g. mutual, hedge, index).  Furthermore, since the
author mentioned that the Sharpe Ratio has been extended to handle scenarios
beyond the original design, it seems worthwhile to consider how these measures
hold up against each other.

Notes
=====

Ex Ante Sharpe Ratio
--------------------

Let :math:`R^F` represent the return on fund :math:`F` in the forthcoming period
and :math:`R^B` the return on a benchmark portfolio or security.  Define the
differential return as

.. math::

   \tilde{d} = \tilde{R}^F - \tilde{R}^B

where :math:`\tilde{\cdot}` indicates that the exact values may not be known in
advance.

Let :math:`\bar{d}` be the expected value of :math:`d` and :math:`\sigma_d` be
the predicted standard deviation of :math:`d`.  The ex ante Sharpe Ratio

.. math::

   S = \frac{\bar{d}}{\sigma_d}

indicates the expected differential return per unit of risk associated with the
differential return.

Ex Post Sharpe Ratio
--------------------

Let :math:`R^F_t` be the return on fund :math:`F` in period :math:`t` and
:math:`R^B_t` the return on a benchmark portfolio or security in period
:math:`t`,  The differential return in period :math:`t` is

.. math::

   D_t = R^F_t - R^B_t.

The ex post Sharpe Ratio

.. math::

   S_h =
   \frac{\bar{D}}{\sigma_D} =
   \frac{
     T^{-1} \sum_{t = 1}^T D_t
   }{
     \sqrt{(T - 1)^{-1} \sum_{t = 1}^T (D_t - \bar{D})^2}
   }

indicates the historic average differential return per unit of historic
variability of the differential return.
