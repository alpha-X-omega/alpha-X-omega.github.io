Market Timing with Candlestick Technical Analysis
#################################################

Motivation(s)
=============

The majority of academic literature have demonstrated that technical analysis
centering around trading rules (e.g. moving average, support and resistance,
range break-out) does not have value once transaction costs and risk adjustment
are taken into account.  In contrast, the entire investment industry have
adopted candlestick technical analysis for short-term horizons.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors analyze the profitability of candlestick technical analysis in order
to reconcile the disparity between academia and industry.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The authors examine holding periods of two, five, and ten days using stocks
from the DJIA during the 1992 - 2002 period.  The price data came from Reuters
and dividend data were sourced from CRSP.  Note that the different holding
periods produced similar results.

The analysis focused on :math:`t`-statistics: compare the returns following a
technical analysis signal to returns when there is no signal.  Returns were
measured on a daily basis as the log difference of price relatives.  To handle
skewness and leptokurtosis, they applied the bootstrapping methodology and
fitted the data to null models such as random walk, AR(1), GARCH-M, and EGARCH.
Note that the different models produced similar and consistent results.

The authors used a 10-day EMA to determine bullish and bearish reversal
patterns.  They executed their trades at the close on the day after a signal;
entering at the open price on the day after a signal gave similar results.

The proportion of times that a trading rule produces more profit on the
bootstrapped series than on the original series following a signal is a
simulated :math:`p`-value for the null hypothesis that the trading rule has no
value.  For instance a bullish candlestick has statistically significant
forecasting power at the 1% level if the simulated :math:`p`-value is less than
0.01.  Put another way, more profit should be produced on the random series than
the original less than 1% of the time.  For a bearish candlestick to have
forecasting power at the 1% level the simulated :math:`p`-value should be more
than 0.99.  In other words, there should be more profit on the random series
than on the original more than 99% of the time.

The results show that candlestick patterns do not yield statistically
significant returns except for the Opening White Marubozu, Long Black, and Black
Marubozu.  The returns following Opening White Marubozu are negative, which is
the opposite to what candlestick technical analysis theory suggests.  Likewise,
contrary to candlestick theory, the bearish Long Black and Black Marubozu
indicate higher than average returns over the next ten days.  Note that none of
the bootstrap results are statistically significant; this indicates that the
:math:`t`-statistic's assumptions is being violated, and thus the foregoing
three patterns may be a coincidence.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- Technical analysis is widely used by humans and possibly algorithms.  How
  to incorporate this self-fulfilling prophecy into a neural network or
  contextual bandit strategy?

Question(s)
===========

- The authors mentioned that it is not appropriate to consider the daily returns
  of candlestick technical analysis on an annual basis.  Why wouldn't
  backtesting with this strategy be a reasonable binary indicator of profits?

Analysis
========

Candlestick lines and patterns are supposed to predict larger than normal
positive returns, but sometimes actually predict smaller than normal returns;
the converse also holds.  However, there are only weak evidence suggesting
candlestick lines and patterns generate predictability in prices.

The analysis is centered around :doc:`statistical significance </blog/2016/09/18/the-standard-error-of-regressions>`
of each candlestick pattern and completely ignores the possible use of each
pattern as an indicator.  The paper would be more interesting if the authors
examined how these weak indicators could be combined to predict trends instead
of prices (e.g. :doc:`contrarian </blog/2016/09/26/when-are-contrarian-profits-due-to-stock-market-overreaction>`
and :doc:`momentum </blog/2016/09/24/profitability-of-momentum-strategies-an-evaluation-of-alternative-explanations>`
strategies).

One interesting point is that three of the candlestick patterns contradicts the
original candlestick theory, which seems to hint that technical analysis should
be more data-driven.  The summary statistics demonstrate that instead of trying
out different statistics, just focus on profit margins.
