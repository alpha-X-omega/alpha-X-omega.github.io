Optimal Control of Execution Costs
##################################

Motivation(s)
=============

A hypothetical portfolio can exhibit 20% in annual returns when trading costs
are ignored, yet the realized gains can be reduced to a fraction (e.g. tenth) of
the original when the strategy is implemented.  This demonstrates that execution
costs (e.g. commissions, bid/ask spreads, opportunity costs of waiting, price
impact from trading) have a substantial impact on investment performance.

Since the typical institutional investor's trades are so large, they tend to be
broken up into smaller trades executed over the course of several days.
Denoting these trade sequences as packages, recent studies on the transactions
of large investment firms show that only one fifth of the market value of these
packages are completed within one day and more than half are spread over four
trading days or more.  Since the act of trading affects price dynamics which in
turn affects future trading costs, the best proprietary execution strategies
cannot be defined in the context of a single transaction.

Proposed Solution(s)
====================

The authors propose a new notion of best-execution strategies: given the price
dynamics that capture market price impact, find the optimal sequence of trades
that minimizes the expected cost of executing :math:`\bar{S}` shares within
:math:`T` periods.  Formally, this is

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
     \min_{\{S_t\}} \quad
       \mathrm{E}\left[ \sum_{t = 1}^T P_t S_t \right] &\\
     \text{subject to} \quad
       \sum_{t = 1}^T S_t &= \bar{S}\\
       0 &\leq S_t \quad t = 1, 2, \ldots, T
   \end{aligned}

where the price dynamics :math:`P_t` follow some "law of motion" such as

.. math::

   P_t = P_{t - 1} + \theta S_t + \epsilon_t, \quad
   \theta > 0, \quad
   \mathrm{E}\left[ \epsilon_t \mid S_t, P_{t - 1} \right] = 0.

They argue that the search for the best-execution strategies needs to be modeled
as a dynamic optimization problem because trading takes time, the demand for
financial securities is not perfectly elastic, and the price impact of current
(possibly small) trades can affect the course of future prices.  The common
naive strategy — breaking up :math:`\bar{S}` shares evenly into a package of
:math:`T` trades each of size :math:`\bar{S} / T` — is a subset of the
best-execution strategies and is optimal only when the price-impact function and
price dynamics obey the proposed (naive) law of motion.

Evaluation(s)
=============

The naive law of motion's purpose is to demonstrate the basic approach to
deriving the best-execution strategies.  Since the objective function is convex,
each decision is optimal for the remaining program and is attained when the
derivative is zero.

The authors derived a closed-form model of linear price impact with information
to better capture market conditions.  Although the numerical examples illustrate
that the best-execution strategies have lower expected execution costs compared
to the naive strategy, the model does not guarantee the lowest execution costs.
This stems from the law of motion's linearity and the assumption that prices
follow arithmetic random walks.  The linearity forces the percentage price
impact, as a percentage of execution price, to be a decreasing function of
price level, which contradicts the fact that absolute price impact increases
linearly with trade size.  The arithmetic random walk could lead to negative
prices and implies that both price impact and information have only permanent
effects on prices, which differs from several empirical studies suggesting
some combination of permanent and temporary effects.

To address the previous limitations, the authors propose a more plausible
law of motion called linear-percentage temporary (LPT) and assume a geometric
Brownian motion for price dynamics.  One additional benefit is that the model is
able to capture the implementation shortfall in executing :math:`\bar{S}`.
Monte Carlo simulations indicate that this model reduces on average 25% to 40%
of the naive strategy's execution costs.

For all of the proposed models, the optimization is unconstrained and consists
of a single security.  Adding constraints require discretization of the state
space or approximating the optimal-value function at each stage.  The former
yields an exact numerical solution while the latter gives an analytical
approximate solution.  Extending these models to a portfolio of securities is
literally rewriting them in vector notation.

Despite the reduction in execution costs, the authors admit there are still many
issues left to resolve:

- The price impact model does not account for market versus limit orders.
- The overall risk of best-execution strategies is due to the variability of
  prices, not to the variability of price impact.
- There are no simple solutions to handle the uncertainty resulting from
  parameter estimation errors and parameter instabilities.
- The maximization of expected utility with transaction costs is analytically
  and computationally intractable.
- The proposed law of motion are unaffected by the investor's trades.

Future Direction(s)
===================

- How to uncover a firm's execution strategy using their published transactions
  history and earnings?
- How should game theory be incorporated into the objective function?
- How can deep learning be used to model an appropriate execution strategy?

Question(s)
===========

- How should the parameters of the proposed models be calibrated?
- How accurate is the claim that the minimum variation of prices on most US
  stocks is $0.125?
- The authors focused on convex solutions to ensure a global optimum, but is the
  desired objective function convex?

Analysis
========

All proposed trading strategies need to account for execution costs to avoid
overoptimistic returns.  Furthermore, the model extension to list trading is
necessary to account for
:doc:`cross effects among the securities </blog/2016/09/26/when-are-contrarian-profits-due-to-stock-market-overreaction>`.

One glaring issue is the lack of backtesting the proposed best-execution
strategies.  It would have been much more interesting to see than simulations
with carefully calibrated models.  These results would make the claim in
cost avoidance more believable.  Likewise, the claim that the approach is still
valid in the presence of adversarial strategies needs to be supported by
evidence.

Nevertheless, the application of the Bellman equation and the derivations in the
appendix are very insightful into future modeling.  The concept of a law of
motion for price dynamics enables future integration of features like
