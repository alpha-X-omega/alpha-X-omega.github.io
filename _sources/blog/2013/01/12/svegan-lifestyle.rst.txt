Svegan Lifestyle
################

Svegan stems from the words shaka and vegan: given the choice, one chooses
to be vegan.  There are proponents that strongly assert one must always be
vegan, but they don't realize the time, effort, and money required to do so.

`This diet`_ have been verified through five health and wellness blood tests
over the span of four years, each separated by approximately nine months.
Supplements are not needed to `build muscle`_.  As the numbers illustrate,
getting the right amount of macronutrients is much easier with supplements.

The proposed combination of exercise and diet should be taken as a `guideline`_.
One should eat until one is no longer hungry, but avoid feeling full.  The focus
is centered around lifestyle, macronutrients, and micronutrients.

Exercise is an `easy`_ activity to `incorporate`_ into one's daily life.  Body
fat is a general concept to be aware of, but one should focus on how the muscles
look instead.  Bodybuilding itself is quite simple when one ignores a lot of
false concepts that are out there (e.g. `somatotype`_).  Make sure the amount
(in grams) of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins are met; once that happens, the
rest revolves around `Total Daily Energy Expenditure`_ (in calories).  Increase
or decrease calorie intake to lose or gain mass respectively.

With all the free online resources (e.g. `The World's Healthiest Foods`_,
`Self NutritionData`_, `rich-vegan-foods`_, `SuperTracker`_), hitting all the
micronutrients is easy nowadays.  Unfortunately, buying the right foods has
become a `huge burden`_.  One should examine the `additives`_ and `ingredients`_
that gets used in `processed foods`_.

Another often neglected topic is wardrobe.  Contrary to popular belief, one does
not need to put in a lot of effort to look `chic`_; the key focus is on how well
one's clothing `fits`_.  As long as one avoids the
