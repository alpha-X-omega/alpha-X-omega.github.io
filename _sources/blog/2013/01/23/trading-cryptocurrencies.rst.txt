Gains and losses from virtual currencies are taxed as `capital assets`_.  It
are less complicated than :doc:`options </blog/2013/01/06/options-trading>`
because only the IRS' 8949 form is involved.

Wallet(s) and Mining
====================

A cryptocurrency wallet is used to store the virtual coins.  It is preferred to
keep this separate from the cryptocurrency exchanges in order to mine them.  An
example of a wallet is `MyEtherWallet`_, which is used to store `ETH`_.  Mining
ETH is only feasible by joining a mining pool (e.g. `ethermine`_).

Another example is `LTC`_ and `LiteVault`_, but it's much more complicated to
mine it.  One needs to have :doc:`CUDA installed </blog/2013/01/09/install-graphics-and-compute-linux-mint>`,
compile `ccminer`_ (possibly modifying the `nvcc_ARCH`_ flag), and then choosing
a `mining pool`_ that has not been hacked.

It is important to know what coins are still `worthwhile to mine`_ i.e. the
`mining probability`_.

Exchange(s)
===========

There are many `cryptocurrency exchanges`_ to choose from.  `GDAX`_ allows the
purchase of virtual currency with fiat while `Bittrex`_ allows trading between
virtual currencies.  All exchanges have issues, but these are the best of the
worst.
