Presenting
**********

These guidelines were extracted from :cite:`spjtalk` and :cite:`kftips`.  It is
applicable to any kind of presentation (e.g. status report).

Purpose of a Talk
=================

- Research is communication: the greatest ideas are worthless if you keep them
  to yourself.

- To give your audience an intuitive feel for your idea.

  - Tell them the most important things they should know, but probably do not.
  - Do not tell them what you did; that's what the paper is for.

- To engage, excite, and provoke them to read your paper.

- Get feedback from others to advance your own research.

- To make them glad they came.

- Do not confuse the purpose intended for your talk versus your paper.

  - Your paper is the beef.
  - Your talk is the beef advertisement.

Cost Analysis of a Talk
=======================

- A bad (unclear) talk will

  - waste the audience's valuable time,
  - forfeit an opportunity for feedback or quality discussion,
  - forgo an opportunity for collaboration,
  - and diminish the impact of your work.

- A good (clear) talk will

  - nonlinearly increase the impact of your work,
  - and increase the likelihood of others reading your paper.

Strive for Clarity within your Target Audience
==============================================

- You should aim for your target audience to understand everything you say in a
  talk.

  - Even if you are targeting experts (e.g. your advisors or peers), note that
    experts have not been thinking about your problem every day.

- It is reasonable to target two audiences:

  - The experts that should understand everything.
  - A broader audience that might understand all but the most technical details.

- The audience has a finite supply of mental effort.

  - They probably just had lunch and are ready for a doze.
  - They have never heard of you, much less read your paper.
  - They want to be led by the hand through the major steps of your story.
  - They do not want to interpret any of your figures or graphs; they want to be
    told how to interpret them (e.g. what to look for).

- The audience does want to spend their energy thinking about

  - potential problems and limitations with what you did (e.g. edge cases),
  - implications of your approach,
  - and connections to their own work.

Structuring your Talk
=====================

- Every sentence matters.

  - Assess the value of why you are saying something; if you can’t justify how
    it will help the listener, take it out.

- 20% Motivational Introduction

  - You have 2 minutes to engage your audience before they start to doze off.

    - The audience are thinking:

      - Why should I tune into this talk?
      - What is the problem?
      - Why is it an interesting problem?
      - Does this talk describe a worthwhile advance?

- 80% Your Key Idea

  - Identify a key idea.
  - Be specific: don't leave your audience to figure it out for themselves.
  - Be absolutely specific: Say "If you remember nothing else, remember this."
  - Choose narrow and deep insights over wide and shallow overviews at all
    costs.
  - It's ok to cover only part of your paper.
  - Examples are your main weapon.

    - When time is short, omit the general case, not the example.
    - Use them to motivate the work, convey the basic intuition, illustrate
      The Idea in action, show extreme cases, and highlight shortcomings.

Etiquette
=========

- Your enthusiasm makes people more receptive.

  - A lack of enthusiasm makes them question why should they be excited for
    your talk.

- Polish your slides the night before to keep it fresh in your mind.
- Do not apologise.

  - I didn't have time to prepare this talk properly.
  - My computer broke down, so I don't have the results I expected.
  - I don't have time to tell you about this.
  - I don't feel qualified to address this audience.

- Script your first few sentences precisely to improve smooth transitions.

  - This could be for each slide, or just the beginning of the talk.

- Face the audience, not the screen.
- Know your material.
- Only show a live demo after you have shown and elaborated on the key points.

  - Show illustrations of your key points pertaining to your demonstration
    first, and if you have time, only then do a live demo.
  - This approach enables the audience to understand even if the demo goes awry.

- Put your laptop in front of you, screen towards you.
- Don't point much, but when you do, point at the screen, not at your laptop.
- Speak to someone at the back of the room, even if you have a microphone.
- Make eye contact.

  - It may help to identify some nodders, and speak to them.

- Watch audience for questions.
- Encourage questions during your talk by pausing briefly now and
  ask for questions.
- Never reveal your points one by one, unless...there is a punch line.
- Use animation effects very sparingly.
- Absolutely without fail, finish on time.

  - Be prepared to truncate your talk and conclude if you run out of time.
  - It is better to connect, and not to present all your material.
  - Continuing is very counter productive since the audience gets restive and
    essentially stop listening when your time is up.
  - Never say "would you like me to go on?"

- The audience is always right.

  - When receiving feedback on a practice talk, do not be defensive!
  - Your tendency will be to be defensive when someone claims an idea in your
    talk was not explained well or was not clear.

    - You will find yourself turning to the relevant slide in your talk and
      saying "I mentioned that here".

    - Sure, you might have mentioned it, but if it wasn’t understood, it’s your
      fault not theirs.

    - Find a way to make it more clear!

    - The correct response is to turn to the appropriate slide and say:
      "I tried to explain that idea here, and this is what I was thinking.  What could I have said to make that point more clear?"

    - The complainer should then work with you to explain what they interpreted
      instead, and offer suggestions on what information they would require to
      have better understood.

Crafting the Contents of your Talk
==================================

- Do not provide an outline slide.

  - It conveys near zero information at the start of your talk and bores your
    audience.
  - You can maybe put up an outline for orientation after your motivation and
    signposts at pause points during the talk.

    - These provide guidance for what you hope to achieve next.
    - If a listener got lost, it’s a good place for them to re-engage.
    - It’s a place for the audience to take a breath.

- Do not present technical (math) details.

  - Present specific aspects only.
  - Refer to the paper for the details.
  - By all means have backup slides to use in response to questions.

- The goal of the intro and background is to tell the listener:
  “Here is the right way to think about the problem I am trying to solve."

  - An excellent strategy to catch the audience’s attention and frame the story
    is to make them aware that there is something they didn’t know they didn’t
    know i.e. “You might think you know this, but here’s a new angle on it.”

- Related work should be discussed *in your framing* of the space.

  - Establishing this framing is the primary value of the intro.
  - Your solution will seem obvious given the framing is done well.
  - You absolutely must know the related work and respond rapidly to questions.
  - You can acknowledge co-authors on the title slide.
  - Praise the opposition, and avoid any negative comments.

- Establish goals and assumptions early (e.g. inputs, outputs, constraints).

  - Your contribution is typically a system or algorithm that meets the stated
    goals under the stated constraints.

- You want the audience to always be able to anticipate what you are about to
  say.

  - This ensures your story is clear, obvious, and possibly easy to present
    without notes.

  - If you keep forgetting what's coming on the next slide, you probably need
    to restructure your talk to achieve a clear narrative.

- Give the why before the what: say where you are going and why you must go
  there before you say what you did.

  - The why provides the listener context, which is especially useful if they
    are getting lost.

    - Assessing how hard they should pay attention.

      - "Is this a critical idea, or just an implementation detail?"

    - Understanding how parts of the talk relate.

      - "Why is the speaker now introducing a new optimization framework?”

  - Example Transitions

    - "We need to first establish some terminology."
    - "Even given X, the problem we still haven’t solved is..."
    - "Now that we have defined a cost metric, we need a method to minimize it...”
    - "Key questions to ask about our approach are..."

- Explain every figure instead of making the audience decode them.

  - Explain every visual element used in the figure.
  - Refer to highlight colors explicitly and explain why the visual element
    is highlighted.
  - Lead the listener through the key points of the figure.
  - A useful phrase is "As you can see..."

- Explain every results graph.

  - Should start with a general intro of what the graph will address.
  - Then describe the labeled axes.
  - Then describe the one point that you wish to make with this results slide.

- One point per slide and the point is the title of the slide.

  - You don’t want to show data on a results slide that is unrelated to the
    point of the slide.

- Titles matter.

  - If you read the titles of your talk all the way through, it should be a
    great summary of the talk.
  - Your slide titles in thumbnail view should present all the points of the
    story you are trying to tell.
  - The reason for meaningful slide titles is convenience and clarity for the
    audience.

- End on a positive note!

  - Many talks end on future work in a manner that stresses problems with
    the current work or enumerates obvious next steps.

    - It’s boring and sort of a bummer for everyone involved.

    - The introduction already covered how to think about the problem being
      solved today.

  - The conclusion is where you contribute intellectual thought to the field
    that refects on what you have done, or about the future, on a broader note.

Reading
*******

It is often helpful to read a paper in multiple passes :cite:`keshav2007read`.
The goal of the first pass should be to determine whether the paper could be
useful.  One way to do this is to

#. Read the title, abstract, and introduction.
#. Read the section and sub-section headings.
#. Examine the figures, diagrams, graphs, and other illustrations.
#. Read the conclusion.
#. Glance over the references to check for previously read materials.

Unless one needs to reproduce or extend the paper, technical details such as
proofs and derivations can be ignored.  :cite:`wgg` provides a list of questions
one should actively attempt to answer while progressing through a paper.

Writing
*******

These guidelines were extracted from :cite:`spjwrite`, :cite:`johnson1993get`,
and :cite:`ddwrite`.

Do Not Wait to Write
====================

.. list-table:: Research Process
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Typical (Wrong) Order
     - Correct Order
   * - Your Idea
     - Your Idea
   * - Do Research
     - Write Paper
   * - Write Paper
     - Do Research

- Writing papers is a primary mechanism for doing research and is not just for
  reporting it.

  - Forces us to be clear and focused.
  - Crystallises what we don't understand.
  - Enables others to critique and collaborate.

One Key Idea per Paper
======================

- Your key idea must be both useful and re-usable.
- If you have a lot of ideas, write lots of papers.
- You want to infect the mind of your reader with your idea, like a virus.
- It is a fallacy to think you need a fantastic idea before you can write
  a paper.

  - Writing the paper is how you develop the idea in the first place.
  - Write a paper, and give a talk, about any idea, no matter how weedy and
    insignificant it may seem to you.

- Be explicit about your idea.

  - You may not know what the one clear, sharp idea is when you start writing,
    but you must know when you finish.
  - "The main idea of this paper is..."
  - "In this section we present the main contributions of the paper."

- Write your abstract after you finish the rest of the paper.

    I try to have four sentences in my abstract.  The first states the problem.
    The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling
    sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.

    -- Kent Beck

- The introduction should describe the problem and state your contributions.

  - Use examples to introduce the problem.
  - The problem should be narrow and deep (i.e. molehills) instead of broad
    and shallow (i.e. mountains).
  - Your list of contributions drives the entire paper: the paper substantiates
    the claims you have made.

    - Use a bulleted list of contributions to make it explicit to the readers.
    - Your contributions should be refutable.

- The introduction (including the contributions) should survey the whole paper,
  and therefore forward reference every important part.

  - For each claim, identify the evidence (e.g. analysis, theorems,
    measurements, case studies), and forward-reference that from the claim.

  - Never write anything along the lines of

      The rest of this paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 introduces the
      problem.  Section 3 ....Finally, Section 8 concludes.

- Explain your idea (as well as the problem) as if you were speaking to someone
  using a whiteboard.

  - Conveying the intuition through concrete examples is primary, not secondary.
  - The intuition guides the readers through the details.
  - Focus on the takeaway and leave the technical details to the next section.

- Be careful when presenting statistics such as
  :doc:`geometric mean </blog/2016/10/22/how-to-not-lie-with-statistics-the-correct-way-to-summarize-benchmark-results>` and
  :doc:`harmonic mean </blog/2016/10/23/characterizing-computer-performance-with-a-single-number>` as evidence.
- Always put related work after the details section of your paper.

  - You should strive to minimize the gap between your reader and your idea.
  - It is a fallacy to think you need to make other people's work look bad in
    order to make your work look good.

    - Crediting others does not diminish the credit you get from your paper.
    - Warmly acknowledge people who have helped you.
    - Be generous to the competition.
    - Acknowledge weaknesses in your approach.

Listen to your Readers
======================

- Each reader (experts and non-experts) can only read your paper for the first
  time once.
- Explain carefully what you want them to focus on (e.g. flow, clarity).
- When you think you are done, send the draft to the competition saying
  "could you help me ensure that I described your work fairly?"

  - They will often response with helpful critique since they are interested
    in the area.

- Treat every review like gold dust.

  - Read every criticism as a positive suggestion for something you could
    explain more clearly.

Establishing Flow and Coherence
===============================

- Old to New

  - Begin sentences with old info, which implicitly creates a link to earlier
    text.
  - End sentences with new info to create a link to the text that follows.

- One paragraph, one point.

  - A paragraph should have one main point expressed in a single point sentence.

    - Typically the point sentence should appear at or near the beginning of the
      paragraph.

- Give information precisely when it is needed, not before.
- Give unique names to things and use them consistently.
- Carve into your mind :doc:`The Science of Scientific Writing </blog/2013/01/18/the-science-of-scientific-writing>`
  and :doc:`Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace </blog/2013/01/19/style-lessons-in-clarity-and-grace>`.

Proofs
======

If you are providing a proof, make sure that it is hierarchically structured
:cite:`lamport2012write`.  Limit the use of jargon.  Save the most technical
material for an appendix.
