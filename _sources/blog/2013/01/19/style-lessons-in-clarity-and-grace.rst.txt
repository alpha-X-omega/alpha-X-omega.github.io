**********************************
Ten Principles for Writing Clearly
**********************************

#. Distinguish real grammatical rules from folklore.
#. Use subjects to name the characters in your story.
#. Use verbs to name their important actions.
#. Open your sentences with familiar units of information.
#. Get to the main verb quickly:

   - Avoid long introductory phrases and clauses.
   - Avoid long abstract subjects.
   - Avoid interrupting the subject-verb connection.

#. Push new, complex units of information to the end of the sentence.
#. Begin sentences that form a unit with consistent subjects/topics.
#. Be concise:

   - Cut meaningless and repeated words and obvious implications.
   - Put the meaning of phrases into one or two words.
   - Prefer affirmative sentences to negative ones.

#. Control sprawl:

   - Don't tack more than one subordinate clause onto another.
   - Extend a sentence with resumptive, summative, and free modifiers.
   - Extend a sentence with coordinate structures after verbs.

#. Above all, write to others as you would have others write to you.

Style as Choice

Understanding Style
===================

- Unclear writing is a social problem rooted in tradition.
- Some writers use complicated sentences to indicate deep thought.
- Some writers are focused on minimizing grammatical errors instead of
  readers' comprehension.
- Some writers need more experience in their academic or professional setting.
- Most writers don't know how readers will interpret their discourse.

Correctness
===========

Present tense inflections
-------------------------

- :math:`\left\{ \text{Singular}, \text{Plural} \right\} \times \left\{ \text{1st Person}, \text{2nd Person}, \text{3rd Person} \right\}`.

  - Only Singular 3rd Person still requires the additional -s.

Three Kinds of Rules
--------------------

- Real Rules

  - Defines the essence of a language.

    - English requires articles (i.e. a / an / the) to precede nouns.

- Social Rules

  - Distinguish between standard and non-standard.
  - Native speakers only think about them when they notice others
    violating them.
  - Only non-native speakers self-consciously try to follow them.

- Invented Rules

  - "Bullshit" invented by grammarians because they can.

    #. Don't split infinitives (e.g. to *quietly* leave).
    #. Don't end a sentence with a proposition (i.e. on, at, in).
    #. Don't use *hopefully* for *I hope*.
    #. Don't use *which* for that (e.g. a car *which* I sold).

Two Kinds of Invented Rules
---------------------------

- Folklore

  #. Don't begin sentences with *and* or *but*.

     - This "rule" probably stems from advice aimed at avoiding
       sentence fragments.
     - This "rule" can be violated; however, subordinate clause beginning with
       *because* usually introduces new information.
     - Words like *since* can be used to begin a sentence with a clause
       expressing familiar about causation.

  #. Use the relative pronoun *that* -- not *which* -- for restrictive clauses.

     - The inventor of this "rule" wanted to remove the random variation
       between *that* and *which*.
     - A nonrestrictive clause modifies a noun naming a referent that you can
       identify unambiguously without the information in that clause.

       - An example would be a company's bankruptcy versus product line.
         There can only be one bankruptcy, but many products can be sold.  The
         former is appropriate for *which* while the latter should use *that*.

     - This "rule" may be broken for stylistic reasons.

       - *that* sounds softer that *which*.
       - Using two *thats* close together doesn't sound good.

  #. Use *fewer* with nouns you count, *less* with nouns you cannot.

     - No one uses *less* with mass nouns (e.g. dirt, pounds).
     - Educated writers often use *less* with countable plural nouns
       (e.g. resources).

  #. Use *since* and *while* to refer only to time, not to mean *because* or
     *although*.

     - People ignore this rule.
     - *since* can be associated with
       "What follows I assume you already know."
     - *while* can be associated with "I assume you know what I state in this
       clause, but what assert in the next will qualify it."

- Elegant Options

  #. Don't split infinitives.

     - This "rule" is nonsense.

  #. Use *whom* as the object of a verb or preposition.

     - A more appropriate rule: use *who* when it is the subject of a verb in
       its own clause; use *whom* only when it is an object in its own clause.
     - When a relative clause modifies a noun, the correct form is *whom* if
       you can delete the relative pronoun and still make sense.  If you
       cannot delete the *who/whom*, the correct form is *who*.
     - You cannot delete *whom* when it begins a clause that is the object of
       a verb.
     - Always use *whom* as the object of a proposition.

  #. Don't end a sentence with a proposition.

     - This is often violated unless one wants a more formal style.
     - Violation of this can end a sentence weakly.

  #. Use the singular with *none* and *any*.

     - This will make the writing style more formal.

Hobgoblins
----------

- Never use *like* for *as* or *as if*.

  - This "rule" is arbitrary nonsense.

- Don't use "hopefully" to mean "I hope".

  - No basis in grammar or logic.

- Don't use *finalize* to mean *finish* or *complete*.

  - Hundreds of other useful words end in -ize.

- Don't use *impact* as a verb; use it only as a noun.

  - No historical evidence of this.

- Don't modify absolute words such as perfect, unique, final, complete,
  etc...with very, more, quite, etc....

  - This is a good "rule" in general, but can be violated.

- Never ever use irregardless for regardless or irrespective.

  - Follow this "rule" despite how arbitrary it is.

- We currently have a problem with singular generic pronouns.

  - "No one should turn in their writing unedited".

    - This solution requires accepting the plural they as a correct singular.

Actions
=======

Principle of Clarity
--------------------

- Make main characters subjects.
- Make important actions verbs.

Verbs and Actions
-----------------

- A sentence seems clear when its important actions are in verbs.
- Readers will think your writing is dense if you overuse abstract nouns.
- Using lots of nominalizations, especially as the subjects of verbs, will make
  your writing turgid.

Revision is a Three-Step Process
--------------------------------

#. Diagnose

   - Ignoring short (four- or five-word) introductory phrases, underline the
     first seven or eight words in each sentence.
   - Look for two results:

     - You underlined abstract nouns as simple subjects.
     - You underlined seven or eight words before getting to a verb.

#. Analyze

   - Decide who your main characters are.
   - Look for actions that those characters perform, especially actions in
     nominalizations.

#. Rewrite

   - If the actions are nominalizations, make them verbs.
   - Make the characters the subjects of the verbs.
   - Rewrite the sentence with subordinating conjunctions (e.g. because, if,
     when, although, why, how, whether, that).

Common Nominalization Patterns to Revise
----------------------------------------

- The nominalization is the subject of an empty verb (e.g. be, seems, has).

  #. Change the nominalization to a verb.
  #. Find a character that would be the subject of that verb.
  #. Make that character the subject of the new verb.

- The nominalization follows an empty verb.

  #. Change the nominalization to a verb.
  #. Replace the empty verb with the new verb.

- One nominalization is the subject of an empty verb and a second
  nominalization follows it.

  #. Revise the nominalizations into verbs.
  #. Identify the characters that would be the subjects of those verbs.
  #. Make those characters the subject of those verbs.
  #. Link the new clauses with a logical connection.

     - To express simple cause: because, since, when.
     - To express conditional cause: if, provided that, so long as.
     - To contradict expected causes: though, although, unless.

- A nominalization follows there is or there are.

  #. Change the nominalization to a verb.
  #. Identify the character that should be the subjects of the verb.
  #. Make that character the subject of the verb.

- Two or three nominalizations in a row joined by prepositions.

  #. Turn the first nominalization into a verb.
  #. Either leave the second nominalization as it is, or turn it into a verb in
     a clause beginning with how or why.

Useful Nominalizations to Keep
------------------------------

- A nominalization that is a short subject that refers to a previous sentence.
- A short nominalization that replaces an awkward "The fact that...".
- A nominalization that names what would be the object of the verb.
- A nominalization that refers to a concept so familiar to your readers that to
  them, it is a virtual character.

Characters
==========

Understanding the Importance of Characters
------------------------------------------

- Readers want actions in verbs, but they want characters as subjects even more.
- Readers prefer concrete subjects over abstract ones (e.g. fear).

Diagnosis and Revision
----------------------

#. Underline the first seven or eight words.
#. Find the main characters.

   - They may be:

     - possessive pronouns attached to nominalizations,
     - objects of prepositions (e.g. by, of),
     - implied.

#. Skim the passage for actions involving those characters, particularly actions
   buried in nominalizations.

   - Ask "who is doing what?".

     - "governmental intervention" :math:`\rightarrow` "government intervenes".
     - "interference" :math:`\rightarrow` "[government] interferes".

   - Be aware that just as actions can be implied in adjectives, so can
     characters.

     - "reliable" :math:`\rightarrow` "rely".
     - "theological" :math:`\rightarrow` "theologians".

#. Reassemble those new subjects and verbs into a sentence using conjunctions.

Reconstructing Absent Characters
--------------------------------

- Readers have the biggest problem with sentences devoid of all characters.
- When you are explaining a complicated issue to someone involved in it, imagine
  sitting across the table from that person, saying *you* as often as you can.

  - If *you* seems not appropriate, change it to a character that is.

- Abstractions as Characters

  - Readers want the subjects of verbs to name flesh-and-blood characters.
  - When the main characters are abstractions, make them the subjects of verbs
    that tell a story.

    - If readers are unfamiliar with the abstractions, avoid using other
      abstract nominalizations around them.

    - English does not have a good solution for naming a generic "doer".

      - Try a general term to describe whoever is doing the action; when that is
        not possible, use *we*.

Characters and Passive Voice
----------------------------

- Active Voice

  - Put the agent or source of an action in the subject.
  - Put the goal or receiver of an action in a direct object.

- Passive Voice

  - The subject names the goal of the action.
  - The agent or source of the action is after the verb in a *by*-phrase or
    dropped entirely.

- Beyond Grammatical Meanings of Active and Passive

  - Both forms can exhibit figurative, impressionistic meanings as well as flat
    feelings.
  - There are exceptions to "Write in the active voice, not in the passive".

- Choosing Between Active and Passive

  - Must your readers know who is responsible for the action?

    - Sometimes we don't know, we don't want the readers to know, or the reader
      doesn't care.

  - Would the active or passive verb help your readers move more smoothly from
    one sentence to the next?

  - Would the active or passive give readers a more consistent and appropriate
    point of view?

    - Pick a point of view and stick to it.

- Passives, Characters, and Metadiscourse

  - Metadiscourse is language that refers not to the substance of your ideas,
    but to yourself, your reader, or your writing:

    - Your thinking and act of writing: We/I will explain, show, argue,
      summarize...
    - Your readers' actions: consider now, as you recall, look at the next
      example...
    - The logic and form of what you have written: first, second; to begin;
      therefore, however, consequently...

  - Beware of dangling modifiers when writing passive sentences.

    - You dangle a modifier when an introductory phrase has an implied subject
      that differs from the explicit subject in the following or preceding
      clause.

  - Deleting *I* or *we* from a sentence does not make it more objective.

    - Avoid using too many *I*'s and *we*'s.

    - Avoid writing a narrative prose.

- Long Compound Noun Phrase

  - Strings of nouns feel lumpy, so avoid them.
  - Revise all compound nouns that consists of more than two nouns, especially
    if they contain nominalizations.

    #. Reverse the order of words.
    #. Find propositions to connect them.

Cohesion and Coherence
======================

Cohesion
--------

- Sense of Flow

  - The last few words of one sentence set up information that appears in the
    first few words of the next sentence.
  - Passive voice allows us to arrange sentences so that they flow from one to
    the next easily.
  - Writers often put words (e.g. this, these, that, those, another, such,
    second, more) at or close to the beginning of a sentence to refer to
    something in a previous sentence.

- Diagnosis and Revision

  #. Begin sentences with information familiar to your readers.

     - Readers get that familiar information from either the words they remember
       from the sentences they just read or prior knowledge.

  #. End sentences with information that readers cannot anticipate.

     - Readers always prefer to read what's new and complex after they read
       what's familiar and simple.

- A passage's overall cohesion trumps the clarity of individual sentences.

Coherence
---------

- A Sense of the Whole

  - The subjects of the sentences need to be related.

- Subjects, Topics, and Cohesion

  - The flaw of defining *subject* as what a sentence is about, its main topic.

    - The subject of a sentence doesn't state its main topic.
    - Other parts of the sentence often "comments" on the topic.

- Diagnosis and Revision

  #. Diagnose

     - Underline the first seven or eight words of every sentence in a passage,
       stopping when you hit a verb.
     - If possible, underline the first five or six words of every clause in
       those sentences.

  #. Analyze

     - Do the underlined words constitute a relatively small set of related
       ideas?  Will the readers see that?
     - Do the underlined words name the most important characters, real or
       abstract?

  #. Rewrite

     - In most of your sentences, use subjects to name their topics.
     - Be sure those topics are, in context, familiar to your readers.

Avoiding Distractions at the Beginning of a Sentence
----------------------------------------------------

- Before you begin writing, name the things you are writing about.

  - Those are your topics; they should be short, concrete, familiar words, and
    more often than not, they should name the main characters in your story.
  - Your topics should tell your readers what a passage is globally about.

- Most of your subjects should be topics.
- Do not vary your subjects for the sake of variety.

Two Qualifications
------------------

- Alleged Monotony

  - "Vary how you begin your sentences" is a BAD idea, especially when you
    change subjects just to make them different.
  - If you have used exactly the same words for the same topics in exactly the
    same positions, you can vary a few of the words that refer to a repeated
    topic.

- Faked Coherence

  - Readers do not need conjunctions (e.g. thus, therefore, however) when your
    sentences are cohesive and the passage they constitute is coherent.
  - Use *but* and *however* when you contradict or qualify what you just said.
  - Use *therefore* or *consequently* to wind up a line of reasoning.
  - Minimize the number of times these words show up in a single page.

Emphasis
========

Understanding How Sentences End
-------------------------------

- Your readers want you to organize your sentences to help them manage:

  i. long and complex phrases and clauses;
  ii. new information, particularly unfamiliar technical terms.

- Carry the reader from simplicity to complexity:

  i. a short introductory phrase or clause,
  ii. followed by a short, concrete subject,
  iii. followed by a verb expressing a specific action;
  iv. after the verb, the sentence can go on for several lines.

Diagnosis and Revision: Stress
------------------------------

- Readers look at the last few words for emphasis.
- Three Tactical Revisions

  #. Trim the end.
  #. Shift peripheral (insignificant) ideas to the left.
  #. Shift new information to the right.

- Six Syntactic Devices to Emphasize the Right Words

  #. There shift: Using "there is/there are" constructions lets you shift a
     subject to the right, thereby emphasizing it more.
  #. Passives: A passive verb lets you flip a subject and object; use it to get
     old and new information in the right order.
  #. What shift: Another device that shifts a part of the sentence to the right,
     thereby emphasizing it more.
  #. It shift: When you have a subject consisting of a long noun clause, you can
     move it to the end of the sentence and start with *it*.
  #. Not only X, but (also) Y (as well): Emphasizes Y.
  #. Pronoun substitution and ellipsis: Instead of repeating the noun, use a
     pronoun; this will avoid flat endings and reader voice drops, which means
     the reader will at least hear emphasis on the word just before *it*.

Topics, Emphasis, Themes, and Coherence
---------------------------------------

- Put key words in the stress position of the first sentence of a passage in
  order to emphasize the key ideas that organize the rest of it.

  - We call those key concepts that run through a passage its themes.

- Help readers identity concepts running through a passage in two ways:

  #. Repeat those that name characters as topics of sentences, usually as
     subjects.
  #. Repeat others as themes elsewhere in a passage, in nouns, verbs, and
     adjectives.

Clarity of Form
***************

Motivation
==========

Understanding Motivation
------------------------

- We read most attentively when we read about a problem that is important (and
  possibly interesting) to us.
- Part 1: Establishing Shared Context

  - Remind readers of what they know (e.g. historical background), have
    experienced (e.g. a recent event), or readily accept (e.g. a common belief).  

- Part 2: Stating the Problem

  - The Two Parts of a Problem

    - The first part is some condition or situation that has potential
      to cause trouble.
    - The second part is the intolerable consequence of that condition, a cost
      that readers don't want to pay.

  - Two Kinds of Problems

    - A practical problem concerns a condition or situation in the world and
      demands an action as its solution.
    - A conceptual problem concerns what we think about something and demands a
      change in understanding as a solution.

      - This may be a small question that contributes to answering a larger,
        more important one; otherwise, the question may not be worth asking.
      - The condition is always something that we do not know or understand.
      - The cost is the dissatisfaction we feel because we don't understand
        something important to us; not the palpable unhappiness we feel from
        pain, suffering, or loss.

- Part 3: Stating the Solution

  - To solve a practical problem, propose that the reader (or someone) do
    something to change a condition in the world.
  - To solve a conceptual problem, state something the writer wants readers to
    understand or believe.

- Another Part: Prelude

  - Most common in humanities and writing for the general public.
  - Typical Approaches: a quotation, a startling fact, an illustrative anecdote,
    or a combination of the previous.

Diagnosis and Revision
----------------------

#. Determine whether you are posing a practical or conceptual problem.
#. Draw a line after your introduction.
#. Divide the introduction into its three parts:
   shared context + problem + solution/main point/claim.
#. Make sure the first word of the first sentence after the shared context is
   *but*, *however*, or some other word indicating that you will
   challenge/qualify that shared context.
#. Divide the problem into two parts: condition and cost.

   - Is the condition the right kind for the problem?
   - Does the cost appropriately answer "So What"?

#. Underline your solution/main point/claim.

Conclusions
-----------

#. Open your conclusion by stating (or restating) the gist of your point, the
   main claim of your paper, the solution to your problem.
#. Explain its significance by answering "So What?" in a new way, if you can;
   if not, restate what you offered in the introduction, now as a benefit.
#. Suggest a further question or problem to be solved, something still not
   known.  Answer "Now What?".
#. End with an anecdote, quotation, or fact that echoes your prelude.

   - Popular writing describe this as your *coda*.

Global Coherence
================

Coherence is an Experience and Does Not Refer to Anything on a Page
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Forecasting Themes to Create Coherence
--------------------------------------

- Document

  #. Identify the start of each new section with a heading that includes the key
     themes for that section.
  #. At the end of the introduction, readers look for the document's main
     point/solution to the problem, which should state the main themes developed
     in the rest.

     - If you choose to save your main point for the conclusion, put a sentence
       at the end of the introduction that promises the point to come and states
       the main themes.

  #. In the body, readers look for the concepts announced as themes at the end
     of the introduction, using them to organize their understanding of the
     whole.

     - Be sure that you repeat those themes regularly.

- Section/Subsection

  #. Readers look for a short segment that introduces the section or subsection.
  #. At the end of that introductory segment, readers look for a sentence that
     states both the point of the section and the special concepts you will
     develop as distinctive themes for that section.
  #. In the body of the section, readers look for the concepts announced as
     themes at the end of the introduction segment, using them to organize their
     understanding of that section.

     - Be sure that you repeat them regularly.

- Put the point sentence at the end of the short opening segment; make it the
  last sentence (e.g. introductory segment) that your reader reads before
  starting the longer, more complex segment that follows.

Two More Requirements for Coherence
-----------------------------------

#. Readers must see how everything in a section or whole is relevant to
   its point.

   - Sentences are relevant to a point when they offer: background or context;
     points of sections and the whole; reasons supporting a point; evidence,
     facts, or data supporting a reason; an explanation of reasoning or methods;
     consideration of other points of view.

#. Readers must see how the parts of your document are ordered.

   - Chronological: time or cause and effect.
   - Coordinate: ordering of the sections according to some criterion
     (e.g. importance, complexity).
   - Logical: complex ordering such as
     :math:`\text{example} \leftrightarrow \text{generalization}`,
     :math:`\text{premise} \leftrightarrow \text{conclusion}`, and
     :math:`\text{assertion} \leftrightarrow \text{contradiction}`.

A Basic Principle of Clarity
----------------------------

- Readers are more likely to judge as clear any unit of writing that opens with
  a short segment that they can easily grasp and that frames the longer and more
  complex segment that follows.

  - A unit of writing entails either a simple or complex sentence, one or more
    paragraphs, one or more pages.

- Get beginnings of the document, major sections, subsections, paragraphs, and
  sentences straight, and the rest is likely to take care of itself.

Concision
=========

Six Principles of Concision
---------------------------

#. Delete meaningless words.

   - E.g. kind of, actually, particular, really, certain, various, virtually,
     individual, basically, generally, given, practically.

#. Delete doubled words.

   - E.g. full and complete, hope and trust, any and all, true and accurate,
     each and every, basic and fundamental, hopes and desires, first and
     foremost, various and sundry.

#. Delete what readers can infer.

   - Redundant Modifiers

     - E.g. terrible tragedy, various different, free gift, basic fundamentals,
       future plans, each individual, final outcome, true facts, consensus of
       opinion.

   - Redundant Categories

     - May have to change an adjective into an adverb or a noun.

   - General Implications

     - Example: imagine someone trying to learn the rules for playing the game
       of chess.

       - Learn -> trying, rules -> playing the game, and chess -> game.
       - Imagine learning the rules of chess.

#. Replace a phrase with a word.
#. Change negatives to affirmatives unless you want to emphasize the negative.

   - Implicitly Negative Words

     - Example verbs: preclude, prevent, lack, fail, doubt, reject, avoid, deny,
       refuse, exclude, contradict, prohibit, bar.
     - Example prepositions: without, against, lacking, but for, except.
     - Example conjunctions: unless, except when.

   - Avoid combining not with negative words.
   - Avoid combining explicitly and implicitly negative words with passives and
     nominalizations.

#. Delete adjectives and adverbs.

Redundant Metadiscourse
-----------------------

- Metadiscourse that attributes your ideas to a source.

  - Announce that something has been observed, noticed, noted, etc...

- Metadiscourse that announces your topic.

  - Call attention to a topic i.e. separate topic and subject.

Hedges and Intensifiers
-----------------------

- Hedges qualify your certainty.

  - Common adverbs: usually, often, sometimes, almost, virtually, possibly,
    alledgely, arguably, perhaps, apparently, in some ways, to a certain extent,
    somewhat, in some/certain respects.
  - Common adjectives: most, many, some, a certain number of.
  - Common verbs: may, might, can, could seem, tend, appear, suggest, indicate.

- Intensifiers increase your certainty.

  - The most common intensifier is the absence of a hedge i.e. 100% certainty.
  - Common adverbs: very, pretty, quite, rather, clearly, obviously,
    undoubtedly, certainly, of course, indeed, inevitably, invariably, always,
    literally.
  - Common adjectives: key, central, crucial, basic, fundamental, major,
    principal, essential.
  - Common verbs: show, prove, establish, as you/we/everyone knows/can see,
    it is clear/obvious that.

- When most readers encounter words like *obviously, undoubtedly, it is clear
  that*, they reflexively think the opposite.
- When using metadiscourse to state a solution, beware of making it sound like
  announcing a topic instead of sounding like advancing a claim.

  - If without the metadiscourse the resulting claim seems self-evident, you
    need to say more or do more thinking about what you want to say.

Concise, Not Terse
------------------

- Mind how your writing feels to your readers.

Diagnosis and Revision: Sprawl
------------------------------

- You feel out of breathe before you come to a place where you can pause to
  integrate all of its parts into a whole that communicates a single conceptual
  structure.
- Rule of Thumb 1: Get to the subject quickly.

  - Move the long introductory clause to the end or turn it into a separate
    sentence.
  - English style have clauses beginning with *if, since, when, although* before
    main clauses, so keep those subordinate clauses short.
  - Use periodic/suspended style sparingly because the deliberately piled up
    introductory subordinate clauses are still tiring to read.

- Rule of Thumb 2: Get to the verb and object quickly.

  - Avoid long, abstract subjects.
  - Avoid interrupting the subject-verb connection; if not possible, then
    minimize the duration.
  - Avoid interrupting the verb-object connection.
  - When a movable prepositional phrase is shorter than a long object, try
    putting the phrase between the verb and object.

Starting with Your Point
------------------------

- Begin a paragraph with a sentence (or two) expressing its point so that
  readers can understand what follows.
- Begin a section of a document with a paragraph or two stating its point.
- Begin a whole document with an introduction that states its point and frames
  the rest.
- The explanation or support material should always follow a point and not
  before.

Reshaping Sprawl
----------------

#. Cut

   - Reduce some of the relative clauses e.g. delete combinations of
     *who, that, which* and *is, was*.
   - Rewrite remaining verb into an *-ing* form.

#. Turn subordinate clauses into independent sentences.
#. Change clauses to modifying phrases.

   - Resumptive Modifiers

     - Find the noun the tacked-on clause modifies, pause after it with a comma,
       repeat the noun, and continue with a restrictive relative clause
       beginning with that.
     - For an adjective or verb, repeat it after a comma and continue.
     - *one that* can be used as a resumptive modifier.

   - Summative Modifiers

     - End a grammatically complete segment of a sentence with a comma, add a
       term that sums up the substance of the sentence so far, and continue with
       a restrictive relative clause beginning with *that*.

   - Free Modifiers

     - Can either begin or end a sentence.
     - Resembles resumptive and summative modifiers, but more focused towards
       commenting on the subject of the closest verb.
     - An adjective, a past participle verb, or an *-ing* present participle can
       denote the start of a free modifier.

#. Coordinate

   - Group the elements into blocks and order them from shorter to longer, from
     simpler to more complex.
   - Emphasize a coordination with correlative conjunctions: both X and Y, not
     only X but Y, (n)either X (n)or Y.

     - The word that comes after *both, not only, (n)either* must be coordinate
       with the word that comes after *and, but, (n)or*.

Troubleshooting Long Sentences
------------------------------

- Faulty Grammatical Coordination

  - We coordinate elements only of the same structure: clause and clause,
    prepositional phrase and prepositional phrase, etc...
  - Nonparallel coordinations do occur in two forms:

    - A noun phrase with a how clause.
    - An adverb with a prepositional phrase.

- Faulty Rhetorical Coordination

  - Ensure the elements are coordinated in thought.

- Unclear Connections

  - Long coordinations can make readers lose track of the internal connections
    and pronoun references.

- Ambiguous Modifiers

  - A modifier at the end of a clause can ambiguously modify either a
    neighboring or a more distant phrase.

- Dangling Modifiers

  - Occurs when its implied subject differs from the explicit subject of the
    main clause.

Elegance
========

Balance and Symmetry
--------------------

- Balanced Coordination: see the block anatomy of Walter Lippmann's speech.
- Uncoordinated Balance: see the block anatomy.
- Use these literary devices to emphasize important points.

Climatic Emphasis
-----------------

#. Weighty Words

   - Adjectives and adverbs are heavier than prepositions, but lighter than
     nouns, the heaviest of which are nominalizations.
   - Nominalizations at the end of a sentence provide a satisfyingly climatic
     thump, particularly when a pair of them are used in coordinate balance.

#. Of + Weighty Word

   - The light *of* (followed by a lighter *a* or *the*) quickens the rhythm of
     a sentence just before the stress of the climatic end.

#. Echoing Salience

   - At the end of a sentence, readers hear special emphasis when a stressed
     word or phrase balances the sound or meaning of an earlier one.

#. Chiasmus

   - This device balances elements in two parts of a sentence, but the second
     part reverses the order of the elements in the first part.

#. Suspension

   - One way to heighten a sense of climax is to open a sentence with a series
     of parallel and coordinated phrases and clauses.
   - The impact of a long suspension is inversely proportional to its
     frequency of use: the less it's used, the bigger the bang.

Nuances of Length and Rhythm
----------------------------

- Think about the length of your sentences only if they are all longer than
  thirty words or so or shorter than fifteen.

  - Some write short sentences to strike a note of urgency, terse certainty, or
    directness.
  - Some write long sentences imbue feelings and thoughts.

Appendix I: Punctuation
***********************

Punctuated Sentence
===================

- Begins with a capital letter.
- Ends with a period or question/exclamation mark.
- Contains at least one word.

Grammatical Sentence
====================

- Subject and verb in a main clause along with everything else depending on that
  clause.

Punctuating the Ends of Sentences
=================================

Common Forms
------------

- Period (or Question/Exclamation Mark) Alone

  - Too many short punctuated sentences may make the prose seem choppy or
    simplistic.
  - Combine too many short grammatical sentences into one long one may result
    in sentence sprawl.

- Semicolon Alone

  - Whatever is on either side of it should be a grammatical sentence.
  - The first grammatical sentence has fewer than fifteen words.
  - The content of the second grammatical sentence is closely linked
    with the first.
  - If used with *however*, *however* must come after it followed up with a
    comma.

- Comma + Coordinating Conjunction

  - Readers expect the end of a grammatical sentence when they see a comma
    followed by two signals: a coordinating conjunction i.e. FANBOYS, or
    another subject and verb.

  - When readers begin a coordinated series of three or more grammatical
    sentences, they expect a comma between them and no internal punctuation.

    - If any of the grammatical sentences has internal punctuation, separate
      them with a semicolon.
    - All of these sentences should be short; otherwise, use a period instead.

  - Omit the comma between a coordinated pair of short grammatical sentences
    if you introduce them with a modifier that applies to both of them.
  - Use comma before *but* to qualify preceding sentence.
  - Minimize the use of this sentence structure to promote style.

Less Common Forms
-----------------

- Period + Coordinating Conjunction

  - Minimize the use of this sentence structure to promote style.
  - Use period before *But* if what follows is important and you intend to go
    on discussing it.

- Semicolon + Coordinating Conjunction

  - Minimize the use of this sentence structure to promote style.

- Conjunction Alone i.e. no preceding comma

  - Though writers of the best prose do this, some teachers consider this
    an error.

- Comma Alone

  - The grammatical sentences are short, a few words each; closely linked in
    meaning e.g. cause-effect, first-second, if-then; and no internal commas.

Special Cases
-------------

- Colon

  - Shorthand for to illustrate, for example, that is, therefore.
  - Avoid a colon if it breaks a clause into two pieces, neither of which is a
    grammatically complete sentence.
  - Put a colon only after a whole subject-verb-object.

- Dash: suggests a casual afterthought.

- Parentheses: insert a short afterthought inside a grammatical sentence.

Intended Sentence Fragments
---------------------------

- Relatively short, fewer than ten or so words.

- Reflect a mind at work: the writer is speaking to you, finishes a sentence,
  then immediately expanding and qualifying it.

  - Almost as an afterthought, often ironically.

Punctuating Beginnings
======================

Five Reliable Rules
-------------------

#. Always separate an introductory element from the subject of a sentence with
   a comma if a reader might misunderstand the structure of the sentence.
#. Never end an introductory clause or phrase with a semicolon, no matter how
   long it is.
#. Never put a comma right after a subordinating conjunction if the next
   element of the clause is its subject.
#. Avoid putting a comma after the coordinating conjunctions if the next
   element is the subject.
#. Put a comma after an introductory word or phrase if it comments on the
   whole of the following sentence or connects one sentence to another.

   - Example introductory words are: fortunately, alledgely, however,
     nevertheless, otherwise.
   - Omit the comma for the exceptional cases: now, thus, hence.

Two Reliable Principles
-----------------------

#. Readers usually need no punctuation between a short introductory phrase and
   the subject.
#. Readers usually need a comma between a long (four or five words or more)
   introductory phrase or clause and the subject.

Punctuating Middles
===================

Subject-Verb, Verb-Object
-------------------------

- Do not put a comma between a subject and its verb, no matter how long the
  subject (nor between the verb and its object).
- If the sentence consists of a list with internal punctuation:

  - Use a colon or a dash at the end of the list of subjects.
  - Add a one-word subject that summarizes the preceding list.

Interruptions
-------------

- Avoid interrupting a subject-verb or verb-object except for reasons of
  emphasis or nuance.
- Always put paired commas around the interruption.

  - Unnecessary clauses should be separated from the main clause with a comma.
  - Do not use a comma when tacking on a necessary subordinate clause at the
    end of an independent clause.

- Adverbial phrases can go before, after, or in the middle of a clause
  depending on the desired emphasis.

Loose Commentary
----------------

- Set off with paired commas, parentheses, or dashes.
- Restrictive Modifiers

  - Uniquely identify the noun they modify.
  - Do not use commas with this.

- Nonrestrictive Modifiers

  - Always set off with paired commas.
  - Adds information that does not change the meaning of the sentence.

- An appositive is a truncated nonrestrictive clause.
- A dash is useful when the loose commentary has internal commas.
- Use parentheses for explanatory footnotes or sotto voce asides.

Punctuating Coordinated Elements
================================

Punctuating Two Coordinated Elements
------------------------------------

- Do not put a comma between just two coordinated elements.
- Four Exceptions

  #. For a dramatic contrast, put a comma after the first coordinate element
     to emphasize the second (keep the second short).
  #. If you want your readers to feel the cumulative power of a coordinated
     pair (or more), drop the *and* leave just a comma.
  #. Put a comma between long coordinated pairs only if you think your readers
     need a chance to breathe or to sort out the grammar.

     - The writer should revise the sentence to avoid this scenario.

  #. If a sentence begins with a phrase or subordinate clause modifying two
     following clauses that are independent and coordinated, put a comma after
     the introductory phrase or clause, but do not put a comma between the two
     coordinated independent clauses.

Punctuating Three or More Coordinated Elements
----------------------------------------------

- A comma must always precede the last one.
- If any of the items in the series has its own internal commas, use
  semicolons to show how readers should group the coordinated items.

Apostrophes
===========

Contractions
------------

- Use an apostrophe in all contracted words.
- Contracted words gives off an informal tone.

Plurals
-------

- Never use an apostrophe to form a plural.
- Exceptions:

  - All lower case single letters.
  - Single capital letters: A, I, U.

- When a word is unambiguously all numbers or multiple capital letters, add
  just *s*, with no apostrophe.

Possessives
-----------

- Singular common or proper nouns.

  - Add apostrophe + s.
  - For singular nouns that already end in *s* or with the sound of *s*, add
    the apostrophe only.

- Plural common and proper nouns that end in *s*: add an apostrophe only.
- Singular compound noun: add an apostrophe + s to the last word.

Appendix II: Using Sources
**************************

Paraphrasing Recasts the Source in a New Sentence Structure
===========================================================

Weaving in the Quotation
========================

- Don't change its meaning.
- Indicate added or changed words with square brackets.
- Signal deletions with three space dots.

  - Use four space dots if you delete a whole sentence or more.

- Add *[my emphasis]* or *[emphasis mine]* after the parts of the quote you
  emphasized using italics, boldface, or underlineation.

Punctuating Quotations
======================

- If the quotation ends in a period, comma, semicolon, or colon, replace it with
  the punctuation you need in your own sentence.

  - If your punctuation is a period or comma, put it before a final
    quotation mark.
  - If your punctuation is a question mark, colon, or semicolon, put it after
    the final question mark.

- If the quotation ends with a question mark or exclamation point and your
  punctuations is a period or comma, drop your punctuation and put the question
  mark before the quotation mark.

- If you use quotation marks inside a quotation, put your comma or period before
  both of the marks.
