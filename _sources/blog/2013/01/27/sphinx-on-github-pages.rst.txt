Sphinx on GitHub Pages
######################

Everything in :doc:`the previous approach to blogging
</blog/2013/01/26/blogging-with-docker>` still applies.  The new item on the
menu is replacing Google App Engine (GAE) with `GitHub Pages`_.  The reason
for this change is GAE's new policy of requiring a billing account to use
their free quota service.

.. _GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com/

Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named *username*.github.io,
where *username* is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

.. code:: bash

   # This command assumes you added SSH keys to your GitHub account
   git clone git@github.com:*username*/*username*.github.io
   cd *username*.github.io
   # Bypass Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages
   touch .nojekyll
   cp -r /path/to/gae/www/* .
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin master
