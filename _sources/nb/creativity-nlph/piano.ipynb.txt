    "scratch as an adult:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain a proper posture, breathe, and relax at all times.\n",
    "- Instead of memorizing mnemonics, memorize the notes!\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Mnemonics for note recognition will hinder your ability to\n",
    "    recognize notes because it's a two step procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always strive for evenness, accuracy, and expression over speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Play the piece at a speed, such as half of the target speed, that\n",
    "    allows all the criteria to be satisfied.\n",
    "  - Increase the speed until one of the criteria starts to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a metronome to practice.\n",
    "- Play without a metronome at the target speed before moving on to\n",
    "  the next piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Play through mistakes; do not stop to correct them because you will develop\n",
    "  stuttering habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This will help you develop the quick recovery needed after a mistake.\n",
    "  - Correct the mistakes later using segmental practice around each mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice hands separate until the speed is faster than the target speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Research has revealed that proficient instrumentalists read single-line\n",
    "    melodies up to seven notes ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice hands together slowly and work towards the target speed even though\n",
    "  hands separate is faster than the target speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The goal is limb independence while satifying all the foregoing criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you practice, you will notice that recognizing the notes is faster if you\n",
    "  use the previous note as a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This is a crutch since it breaks down when notes are too far apart.\n",
    "  - More practice will enable you to recognize the note's pitch, your hand\n",
    "    placement, and eventually the pitch's sound."
